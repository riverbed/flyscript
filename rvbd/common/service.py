"""
This module defines the Service class and associated authentication classes.
The Service class is not instantiated directly, but is instead subclassed
to implement handlers for particular REST namespaces.

For example, the Shark is based on Service using the "shark" namespace, and
will provide the necessary methods to interface with the REST resources available
within that namespace.

If a device or appliance implements multiple namespaces, each namespace will
be exposed by a separate child class.  The Cascade Express product implements
both the "profiler" and "shark" namespaces.  These will be exposed via Shark
and Profiler classes respectively, both based on the the Service class.
A script that interacts with both namespaces must instantiate two separate
objects.
