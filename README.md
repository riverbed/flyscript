Quick Start
===========

If you are familiar with installing Python packages, the FlyScript
package leverages the standard setup.py based on setuptools.  You may
want to first setup virtualenv before running setup.  See the
'virtualenv' section in the installation guide.

To get started, you need to complete the following steps:

1. Download the FlyScript package and extract the contents
2. Optionally set up virtualenv
3. Install the FlyScript package using "cd flyscript && python setup.py install"
4. Test it with "python examples/about.py"
5. Read the docs at "docs/html/index.html"
6. Look at the examples in "examples"

Start coding!
